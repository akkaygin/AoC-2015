# Advent of Code 2015
This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015). These solutions are written in Python, focusing on solving each problem rather than optimizing for speed, minimal lines of code, or elegance. The goal is to learn, have fun, and enjoy the problem-solving process.

I chose Python for this challenge because of its simplicity, particularly in handling string operations. Python makes string parsing, pattern matching and manipulation extremely simple, which are extensively used in AoC problems. It also made some tasks very simple, so I might try another language next time.
